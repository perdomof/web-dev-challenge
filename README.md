## Part 1
### Setup

Please fork this repository to your own github, clone your personal repo, and complete the tasks there

## Part 2 (Required)
### Making it work

Typing a phrase into the text input and hitting the ENTER key or clicking the "Check" button should result in correctly letting you know if the entered phrase is a palindrome or not.

For this to work correctly you must implement the code for 2 functions, `RemoveWhitespace` and `IsItAPalindrome`.

Once you think you have it, enter some phrases and test it out yourself.

In addition to your own tests you can click the "Test" button in the lower left hand corner of the page (OR run `Text()` in the console if you prefer) to see how you do against some tests we've come up with.

Your solution should pass all tests, run with no errors, and have useful comments where your feel necessary!

NOTE: We expect you to be able to complete this challenge without the need for any addition JavaScript libraries (that means NO jQuery). However, if you use any online references please include links in your comments to the source.

## Part 3 (Optional)
### Making it better

Here is where you can feel free to improve on the look, feel, and functionality of the site as you please (provided you stick to not using any additional JavaScript libraries).

## Part 4
### Submission

To submit, push all your work and changes to your own repo and create a pull request to the original repository's master branch. Be sure to include any and all additional changes you might have made either in code comments, your ReadMe file, or in an addition .txt file.
